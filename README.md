# Airbnb Data Analysis with Python 🏡📊

## Overview

This project explores an Airbnb dataset to uncover key insights using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand pricing trends, availability, and key patterns. Additionally, the project aims to extend the analysis with predictive modeling to forecast Airbnb pricing trends.

## Project Highlights

### ✅ Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values (111 across various columns) to ensure data integrity.
- Dropped duplicate entries to eliminate redundancy and improve accuracy.
- Converted data types where necessary to ensure consistency in analysis.
- Standardized column names for better readability and usability.

### ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Univariate Analysis:**
  - Analyzed individual feature distributions to detect anomalies and outliers.
  - Identified skewness in the price distribution, indicating the presence of luxury stays.
- **Bivariate Analysis:**
  - Explored relationships between price and neighborhood.
  - Created a new feature, **Price Per Bed**, to compare affordability across different regions.
- **Multivariate Analysis:**
  - Used scatter plots and heatmaps to examine correlations between price, room type, availability, and location.
  - Identified patterns in seasonal availability and high-demand periods.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Manhattan** has the highest average price per bed, making it the most expensive borough.
- **Staten Island** is the most affordable borough for Airbnb listings.
- The majority of Airbnb listings are available for **350 days per year**, suggesting a high number of full-time rental properties.
- Certain listings with extreme prices are likely either **luxury stays** or **incorrect data entries**.
- Private rooms are generally more budget-friendly compared to entire home rentals, but vary significantly across neighborhoods.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Implement **predictive modeling** to forecast Airbnb pricing trends based on historical data.
- Utilize machine learning algorithms like **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest** to analyze factors influencing price variations.
- Incorporate **time series forecasting** to understand seasonal trends in Airbnb bookings.
- Optimize pricing strategies using **clustering techniques** to segment different listing types.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization Tools:** Seaborn, Matplotlib for data visualization and pattern recognition
- **Machine Learning (Future Scope):** Scikit-learn for predictive modeling and forecasting
